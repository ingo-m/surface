### Prepare CBS tools docker image ###
######################################

# As of March 2018, CBS tools still needs to be installed manually using the
# mipav Java GUI. Therefore, we create a debian docker image using 
# `Dockerfile_CBS.txt`, and manually install CBS tools and its dependencies
# in the image. Afterwards, the resulting container is commited into the final
# image.

# Build image from dockerfile:
cd /home/john/PhD/GitHub/PacMan/docker
docker build -t dockerimage_cbs -f /home/john/PhD/GitHub/PacMan/docker/Dockerfile_CBS.txt .

# Enable x11 clients (at the host terminal)
xhost +local:all


# Install mipav (using the GUI):
docker run -it --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v /media/sf_D_DRIVE/Tools/mipav/mipav/v7p3p0:/home/john/Downloads/mipav:ro \
    dockerimage_cbs bash

# In order for the container not to shut down before it can be committed, we
# need to call the installation script from command line within the terminal:
/home/john/Downloads/mipav/installMIPAV.bin
# Use default options; expect for memory allocation, use 16000 MB.

# FROM A SEPARATE TERMINAL AT THE HOST, check the ID of the active container:
docker ps -a

# Commit the active container to a new image:
docker commit a32788c9c840 dockerimage_cbs_tmp

# Exit the docker container:
exit

# Install CBS tools, JIST, and TOADS-CRUISE:
docker run -it --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v /media/sf_D_DRIVE/Tools/mipav/plugins:/home/john/Downloads/plugins:ro \
    dockerimage_cbs_tmp bash

/home/john/mipav/mipav

# In the GUI, go to "Plugins" > "Install Plugin". Select the "Browse" buttom and
# select the directory with the three plugin files downloaded earlier (i.e.
# "/home/john/Downloads/plugins/"). The three files should show up on
# the left. Select the three files, and click the right arrow in the centre to
# move them to the right. Click the "Install Plugin(s)" button at the bottom of
# the window. The installation may take a few seconds. There may be a success
# message ("The following plugins were successfully installed to
# /home/john/mipav/plugins/: ..."), or an error message. If there is an error
# message, ignore it.

# Create library folder:
mkdir /home/john/mipav/my_library

# Configure CBS tools:
/home/john/mipav/mipav

# In the GUI, select "Plugins" > "JIST" > "JISTLayoutTool". A new window will
# open; it will ask you to select a library directory. Specify the empty
# directory just created ("/home/john/mipav/my_library"). JIST will be allowed
# to store a cache of module definitions here.

# In the new window which opened, go to "Project" > "Rebuild Library". When asked
# whether to replace and recreate libraries, select "Yes". This process should
# take about a minute. 

# Create symbolic link:
sudo ln -s /home/john/mipav/mipav /usr/local/bin/mipav

# FROM A SEPARATE TERMINAL AT THE HOST, check the ID of the active container:
docker ps -a

# Commit the active container, e.g.:
docker commit fd62205b8e96 dockerimage_cbs

# Exit the docker container:
exit

# Save image to tar file:
docker save dockerimage_cbs -o /media/sf_D_DRIVE/MRI_Data_PhD/05_PacMan/Docker_Metadata/dockerimage_cbs.tar
